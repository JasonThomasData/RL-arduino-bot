### Requirements

You should download the Arduino IDE to compile the src to your board.

This project uses an Arduino Nano ATMega168 board, or clone. Much of the work on this project was completed using a Mac computer, and if you're using a clone, you will need to [download drivers](https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver).
